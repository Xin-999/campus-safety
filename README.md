Track 2: Campus Management(Campus Safety App)

Problem Statement
Students often attend late-night classes or activities, and the walk back to their dorms, apartments, or cars may not always feel safe. Limited visibility, isolated areas, and lack of immediate support can leave students vulnerable during these walks.
